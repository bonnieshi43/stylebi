# Generating InetSoft-Icons

The icons and SASS files are generated by the build scripts. You
only need to add the new icon file and run the build script.

To add an icon to the font, just add the SVG file for the icon into
the icon_svg directory.

After adding the new icon file, run the following command in the
top-level project directory:

```bash
$ gradlew :web:generateFont
```

For example, if you want to add an icon called "new-thing", you'd add
a file named "new-thing" to the icon_svg directory. After building,
the new icon will be mapped to the "new-thing-icon" CSS class.
