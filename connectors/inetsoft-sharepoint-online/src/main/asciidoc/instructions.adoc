InetSoft Technology <info@inetsoft.com>
v13.0 2019-10-25

The SharePoint Online data connector allows you to query against lists in
your SharePoint sites.

== Preparation

In order to use this data connector, you need to register an application
in Azure. You can do this by following these steps.

1. First, open the Azure administration portal
(https://portal.azure.com[portal.azure.com]) in your web browser and log
in using the administrator account for your SharePoint site.

2. Search for and select "app registrations".

4. Enter a name for the application. In this example, we will be using
"Style Intelligence". Make sure that the single tenant option is selected
for the account type. No redirect URI is necessary. When this is done,
click the "Register" button.

5. Select the "Authentication" blade. Enable the "Treat application as a
public client" option and click "Save".

6. Select the "API Permissions" blade. Click the "Microsoft Graph" API
link in the permissions table. Select the "Group/Group.Read.All" and
"Sites/Site.Read.All" permissions. Click the "Update permissions" button.
The group permission is required if you want to be able to access lists in
your group team sites.

button. Enter a description, for this example, we are using "Tabular Data
Source". Select an expiration for the secret and click the "Add" button.

Make sure to copy the secret displayed in the secrets table now, as it is
the last time you will be able to do so.
+

8. Click the "Overview" blade. Copy the "Application (client) ID" and the
"Directory (tenant) ID" values. These will be used for the client ID and
tenant ID, respectively, in the data source configuration.

== Data Source Configuration

The next step is to create a data source for your SharePoint sites. This
can be done in the Style Studio, or if using version 2018 or later, in
the user portal. For this example, we will be using the Style Studio.

1. Select the "File/New..." menu.

2. Select "Data Source" in the left-hand pane and "SharepointOnline" in
the right-hand pane. Click the "OK" button.
+

"Sharepoint". Click the "Finish" button.
+

client ID, tenant ID, and client secret that you should have copied
during the Preparation section. Click the save button.
+

able to connect at this point.

== Create a Query

1. Navigate to your data source under "Data Source" in the "Asset" tree
on the left side of the screen.

2. Right-click your data source and select the "New Query" menu.

3. Enter a name for your query. For this example, we will be using
"Sales Records". Click the "Finish" button.
+

4. Select the site and list that you want to query. For this example,
we will be using the "Communication site" site and the "Sales Records"
list. Click the save button.
+

You can now use the query in a report or dashboard.
