/**
 * BufferFileOutputStream is an OutputStream that uses an in-memory buffer
 * to store data, up until a specified size (limit), at which point the buffer
 * switches to using a File-based buffer in order to conserve memory.
 *
 * Temporary files are created with deleteOnExit, but it is preferable to
 * explicitly call the dispose method to immediately clean up this object.
 *
 * BufferFileOutputStream objects do not support re-use; meaning, once you have
 * used a BufferFileOutputStream object, then you should dispose of it and
 * create a new instance if you need another stream.
