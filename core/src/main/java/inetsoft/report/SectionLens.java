/**
 * A SectionLens represents a section element. A section can have a header
 * band, footer band, and a content band. The content band is required, and
 * the other two bands are optional. The content band can contain another
 * section, which is called a nested section.
 * <p>
 * A section can be used to display the contents of a TableLens, in which
 * case the section header corresponds to the table header, and is repeated
 * at the top of each page. The section content corresponds to rows in the
 * table, and is repeated for each row. The section footer corresponds to
 * the group summary if the table is a grouped table.
 * <p>
 * A section can also be used to present fixed position elements, where
 * the contents of the elements are statis or bound at runtime individually
 * to each element. The header and footer normally don't apply in this
 * situation.
