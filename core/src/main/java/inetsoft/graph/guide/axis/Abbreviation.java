/**
 * Label value and anchor if the label is abbreviated. Anchor is the string that should be
 * displayed if there is no previous year label showing the year. For example, if '2021 Jan' is
 * abbreviated to '2021', anchor is '2021'. If '2021 Feb' is abbreviated to 'Feb',
 * anchor is '2021'. For labels that keeps year, for example, '2021 1st, 2021 2nd', the
 * first abbreviation would be ('2021 1st, '2021 1st') and the second ('2nd', '2021 2nd').
 * If the first name is removed, second label would be changed from '2nd' to '2021 2nd' so
 * the year part is not lost.
